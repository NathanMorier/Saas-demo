In my latest SaaS experiment, I developed a simple task manager application that utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This project includes user authentication, allowing users to log in, add tasks with a title and description, and delete tasks as needed. All task data is stored in the browser's local storage, enabling persistent access across sessions without relying on server-side storage.
