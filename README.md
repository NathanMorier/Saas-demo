In my latest SaaS experiment, I developed a simple task manager application that utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Explore two distinct versions of the Task Manager, the first version enables users to create tasks that are saved in the browser's local storage. You can log in using:

username: <em>test</em><br>password: <em>password123</em>

The second version offers a more robust experience, allowing users to register, create a personalized login, and manage tasks stored in an online database. This feature grants users the flexibility to access their tasks from anywhere!
